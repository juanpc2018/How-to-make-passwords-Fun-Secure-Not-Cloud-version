and i had to see if was true:

Not only 1 but 2.

Passwords are becoming a problem for many people,
too many forums, too many emails, too many passwords...
but Not too many money. LOL.™

some people are visual, remember visual clues more easy
like the movie:
Mercury Rising (1998) https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120749/
an autistic 9 year old breaks a billion dollar NSA password.

some people are more auditory, remember songs very easy.
or like to measure things...
like the movie:
The Goonies (1985) https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089218/

here are some ideas for people that are Not Rain Man (1988)
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/

Idea #1.
for people that like to measure...
There are Calipers Mitutoyo clones, that have a port to usb device,
the optional usb dongle, at the push of a button sends the measured distance as txt to PC.
The better the caliper, the more decimals, and the more accurate is the repetition of the measurement,
The idea of using a Ruler as a password is that:
"Only you know the distance"
can be any number, caliper comes from 6" 8" 10" 12" 24" 40"
basic calipers have inches or milimeters,
but more advanced also has fractions: 1/128 of an inch.

most websites do Not allow Only Numbers,
but the distance can be part of the password,
at the beggining, at the end, in the middle, both..
and its easy because its a push of a button,
some USB dongles are wireless.

This password method is Not NSA level, but its fun.
for example:
Pi3.1415
the 3.1415 is the push of a button, very easy & fun.

what makes people get bored with passwords is the time wasted,
just think how much time you waste in your life typing "secure" passwords.
Saving Time is key.

Idea #2.
like the movie The Goonies organ scene,
https://youtu.be/pUO7Ip0Xc10
there is a simple software called MIDI-OX
http://www.midiox.com/
combined with a real MIDI Keyboard or a Virtual Midi Piano Keyboard,

works in Wine / PlayOnLinux / PlayOnMac / Bottles / Crossover
shows Midi information as Hexadecima value.
MIDI is 7-Bits = 128 "0-127"
and has many different kinds of MIDI messages,
Note On / Off, Volume, Pan and 128 continuos controllers: MSB, LSB, etc...
Pitch Bend is 14-Bit,

you simply remember a short combination, a melody, Tune or chord
the software gives you a long Hexadecimal value, you simply copy & paste.

problem of this method is that most login and passwords are limited to 40 characters.
in theory this is the safest method against BruteForce attack,
because the password is easy to remember, and generates a very long string of characters.
One tune for the log-in, another tune for the password.
impossible to break by CPU & GPU brute force softwares like:
ParallelPasswordRecovery.com

This makes me think that some software and websites that limit password lenght,
to only 40 characters, is very suspicious.

other problem, is that most people are gonna use a Top 100 Tune or the song of the moment,
but you can make variations, like selecting a different ocatave, etc...

There are other sollutions like Authy Desktop app for 2nd verification, used by some websites,

Idea #3. making your own Arduino USB password dongle, 
plug, select a password stored in Eeprom, with the 8x16 screen,
push a buttom, done.
for DIY project.

ive seen many other methods online,
a DIY magnetic strip card reader / simcard reader.
you simply slide the plastic card in a USB dongle, and types the password for you.
differnt cards, diferent log-in or passwords.
has a software to write the password to the magnetic strip, 
simple ideas to make passwords more fun.

This is just for Fun,
if you have something very important or high value, 
you need other methods to secure the assets, Not 100% single Biometric,
people will remove your eyes if they need, like Haiti president... eye was scooped out with a spoon.
Very secure items need 3 people biometric security working simultaneously, 
to Disincentivize people from hiring mercenaries to scoop your eyes or chopp your fingers.

LOL.™
